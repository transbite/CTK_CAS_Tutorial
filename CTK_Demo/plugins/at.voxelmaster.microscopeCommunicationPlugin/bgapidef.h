/*	Pixel Type Defines
	---------------------------------------
	see GigE Vision Specification Draft 1.5.0 January 2, 2006 chapter 26 of GigE Vision Standard

	The following provides defines for the various pixel types supported by bgapi. Each pixel type is
	represented by a 32-bit value. The upper 8-bit indicates the color. The second upper 8-bit indicates the
	number of bit occupied by a pixel (including any padding). This can be used to quickly compute the amount
	of memory required to store an image using this pixel type.

	This definitions are valid for bgapi iamge transfers !!!
